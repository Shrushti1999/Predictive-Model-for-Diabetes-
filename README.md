**PROBLEM STATEMENT** 

Diabetes Mellitus is a widespread chronic condition in which the body's ability to metabolize glucose is impaired. Predictive Model for Diabetes is a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning model that predicts if a patient has diabetes or not based on their laboratory results.   

**PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**

* The core idea of the project is to solve a problem statement.   
* The problem is associated with the detection of diabetes. Early detection of the disease lowers medical expenditures as well as the likelihood of people developing more severe health problems.  
* The project has three primary stages: creating the model, training the model, and testing the model. Creating the model entails further sub-activities: obtaining, analyzing, and preparing data. Train the model involves selecting and implementing a two-class averaged perceptron. Finally, predict the patient's diabetes by testing the model.   
* The project was created on Microsoft Machine Learning Studio (classic) using the Azure Open Dataset - Pima Indians Diabetes Binary Classification dataset. Further, the web service is set up and deployed to publish to Gallery. The accuracy achieved is 78.6%.  
* This approach can help physicians forecast individuals at risk of developing diabetes in the future and provide them with essential preventative measures.   

**DATASET**

The Pima Indians Diabetes Binary Classification dataset from the Azure Open dataset is used, which has 768 rows and 9 columns ( 8 features and 1 label ).
* Number of times pregnant
* Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* Diabetes pedigree function
* Age (years)
* Class variable (0 or 1) : 268 of 768 are 1, others are 0.  

 **CONCLUSION**
 
The project's main contribution was proposing a predictive model using a machine-learning technique, two-class averaged perceptron, to identify patients with a high risk of developing Diabetes Mellitus. It is developed on Microsoft Machine Learning Studio (classic), which provides a drag and drop feature for all tasks and an interactive design interface. This predictive model was created and validated on the Indian population using the Azure Open dataset - Pima Indians Diabetes Binary Classification dataset, reflecting diabetes risk patterns. The model addressed the issue of cleaning up missing data. The training experiment is set up into a predictive experiment which is then deployed into a web service. The deployment even provides codes in multiple programming languages. Both training experiment and predictive experiment is published in the Azure gallery. The model's capacity to detect diabetes patients is high, and it is approximately 78.6% accurate. 

This project can be set up as an online computer application to assist physicians in assessing the risk of Diabetes Mellitus in Indian patients.
