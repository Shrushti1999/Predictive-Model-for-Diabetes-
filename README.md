# Predictive-Model-for-Diabetes-
PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Diabetes Mellitus is a widespread chronic condition in which the body's ability to metabolize glucose is impaired. Predictive Model for Diabetes is a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning model that predicts if a patient has diabetes or not based on their laboratory results.   

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 

The core idea of the project is to solve a problem statement.   
The problem is associated with the detection of diabetes. Early detection of the disease lowers medical expenditures as well as the likelihood of people developing more severe health problems.  
The project has three primary stages: creating the model, training the model, and testing the model. Creating the model entails further sub-activities: obtaining, analyzing, and preparing data. Train the model involves selecting and implementing a two-class averaged perceptron. Finally, predict the patient's diabetes by testing the model.   
The project was created on Microsoft Machine Learning Studio (classic) using the Azure Open Dataset - Pima Indians Diabetes Binary Classification dataset. Further, the web service is set up and deployed to publish to Gallery. The accuracy achieved is 78.6%.  
This approach can help physicians forecast individuals at risk of developing diabetes in the future and provide them with essential preventative measures.
